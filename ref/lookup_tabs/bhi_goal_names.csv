FP,NA,Food Provision,"This goal measures the amount of seafood sustainably harvested in a given region through any means for use primarily in human consumption and thus includes wild-caught commercial fisheries, mariculture, artisanal-scale and recreational fisheries."
FIS,FP,Fisheries,"This subgoal model aims to assess the amount of wild-caught seafood that can be sustainably harvested, with sustainability defined by multi-species yield, and with penalties assigned for both over- and under-harvesting."
MAR,FP,Mariculture,This subgoal measures the ability to obtain maximal seafood yield from farm-raised facilities without damaging the ocean's ability to continue providing fish for people in the future.
AO,NA,Artisanal Fishing Opportunity,"This goal captures the access people have to coastal resources, whether or not they actually take fish or harvest from coastal waters."
NP,NA,Natural Products,This goal model calculates overall status by weighting the status of sustainable harvest of each product by its proportional value relative to other harvested products.
CS,NA,Carbon Storage,This goal captures the carbon stored in natural coastal ecosystems that absorb and sequester carbon in large amounts.
TR,NA,Tourism & Recreation,This goal captures the value people have for experiencing and taking pleasure in coastal areas.
LE,NA,Coastal Livelihoods & Economies,This goal aims to maintain coastal and ocean-dependent livelihoods and productive coastal economies while also maximizing livelihood quality.
LIV,LE,Livelihoods,This subgoal evaluates the benefits people obtain from the oceans in the form of jobs and wages.
ECO,LE,Economies,This subgoal captures the economic value associated with marine industries.
SP,NA,Sense of Place,This goal aims to capture the level of protection for aspects of the coastal and marine system that contribute to a person's sense of cultural identity.
ICO,SP,Iconic Species,This subgoal captures the species that are important to a region because they are relevant to local cultural identity.
LSP,SP,Lasting Special Places,"This subgoal captures the conservation status of geographic locations that hold significant aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational, or existence value for people."
CW,NA,Clean Waters,"This goal captures the degree to which waters are polluted by nutrients, contaminants and litter."
EUT,CW,Eutrophication,This subgoal captures the degree to which waters are polluted by nutrients.
TRA,CW,Trash,This goal captures the degree to which waters are polluted by litter.
CON,CW,Contaminants,This goal captures the degree to which waters are polluted by contaminants.
BD,NA,Biodiversity,This goal captures the conservation status of marine species.
