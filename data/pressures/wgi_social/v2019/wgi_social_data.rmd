# Prepare Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) for Social pressure data layer 

## 1. Background 
The [Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) project](http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/index.aspx#home) reports aggregate and individual governance indicators for 215 economies over the period 1996â€“2018, for six dimensions of governance: 

- Voice and Accountability  
- Political Stability and Absence of Violence 
- Government Effectiveness  
- Regulatory Quality  
- Rule of Law  
- Control of Corruption  

## 2. Data  
OHI has already extracted these data by country.
