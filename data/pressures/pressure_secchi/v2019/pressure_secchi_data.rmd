#### 2.1.1 Secchi Depth {-}
<!-- dataset save location BHI_share/BHI 2.0/Goals/CW/EUT/SecchiDepth_ICES -->

Data are the same as were used for the secchi clean water indicator, obtained from the [ICES Oceanographic database](http://ecosystemdata.ices.dk/inventory/Index.aspx?). More about the data sources and data preparation can be found in the [Clean Water subgoal Eutrophication](https://github.com/OHI-Science/bhi-prep/blob/master/data/CW/eutrophication/v2019/eut_data.rmd) which uses secchi data as one measure of eutrophication status.
