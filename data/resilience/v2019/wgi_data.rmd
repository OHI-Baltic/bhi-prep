# Preparation of Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) for Social Resilience Data Layers

## 1. Background
The [Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) project](http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/index.aspx#home) reports aggregate and individual governance indicators for 215 economies over the period 1996â€“2014, for six dimensions of governance: 

- Voice and Accountability  
- Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism  
- Government Effectiveness  
- Regulatory Quality  
- Rule of Law  
- Control of Corruption  

### 1.1 Data  
OHI has already extracted these data by country.  
For BHI, we obtained these data on 21 August 
2020 from [the file 'wgi_combined_scores_by_country.csv' on the OHI github site](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep/tree/master/globalprep/prs_res_wgi/v2017/intermediate).
