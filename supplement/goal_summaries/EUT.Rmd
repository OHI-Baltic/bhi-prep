### 1.1 Goal Description {-}

The Eutrophication sub-goal of the Clean Water goal captures the degree to which local waters are unaffected by eutrophication. For the BHI five indicators were included: 

-	Winter (December-February) dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations in the surface layer (0 - 10 m depth) 
-	Winter (December-February) dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentrations in the surface layer (0 - 10 m depth) 
-	Summer (June-September) chlorophyll a concentration in the surface layer (0 - 10 m depth)  
-	Summer (June-September) Secchi depth  
-	Hypoxic area below the halocline  

The first four indicators are HELCOM core indicators (Baltic Sea Environmental Proceedings No 143). Hypoxic area is calculated using the ICES HEAT assessment tool, [in a separate repository](https://github.com/OHI-Baltic/HEAT).

### 1.2 Model & Data {-}

The geometric mean of the status of all five indicators have been calculated for Bornholm Basin, Western Gotland Basin, Eastern Gotland Basin, Northern Baltic Proper and Gulf of Finland. For the other basins only four indicators (without hypoxic area) have been used to calculate the eutrophication status.

-	Mean Summer Secchi depth (June-September) data from ICES database.
-	Winter (DIN), (DIP), and summer chorophyll a data have been downloaded from the Baltic Nest Institute database (DAS and NEST); additional chlorophyll a data come from ICES and SMHI.
-	Hypoxic area calculations are based on oxygen data from ICES (CTD and bottle data). Deep water anoxia are defined as O2 level <2 mg⋅L−1. It represents the long-term effects of human activities on nutrient levels and water quality (Carstensen et al. 2014). We used deep water anoxia for the following basins:

<br/>

#### 1.3.1 Secchi depth Indicator {-}

_Secchi depth_ reference points are set based on the results obtained in the TARGREV project (HELCOM 2013a), taking advantage of the work carried out during the EUTRO PRO project (HELCOM 2009) and national work for WFD. The final targets were set through an expert evaluation process done by the intersessional activity on development of core eutrophication indicators (HELCOM CORE EUTRO) and the targets were adopted by the HELCOM Heads of Delegations.

#### 1.3.2 Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen and Phosphorus, and Chlorophyll a {-}

Reference points for the _winter (DIN), (DIP), and summer chlorophyll_ a have been assessed from the Baltic Sea Environmental Proceedings No 143.

<br/>

#### 1.3.3 Anoxic Area Indicator {-}

The _hypoxic area_ reference point is set to be the hypoxic area of each basin in 1906.
