### 1.1 Goal Description {-}

The Eutrophication sub-goal of the Clean Water goal captures the degree to which local waters are unaffected by eutrophication. For the BHI five indicators were included: 

-	Winter (December-February) dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations in the surface layer (0 - 10 m depth) 
-	Winter (December-February) dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentrations in the surface layer (0 - 10 m depth) 
-	Summer (June-September) chlorophyll a concentration in the surface layer (0 - 10 m depth)  
-	Summer (June-September) Secchi depth  
-	Oxygen debt indicator  

The first five indicators are HELCOM core indicators (Baltic Sea Environmental Proceedings No 143). Oxygen debt is calculated using the ICES HEAT assessment tool, [in a separate repository](https://github.com/OHI-Baltic/HEAT). 

<br/>

### 1.2 Model & Data {-}

The geometric mean of the status of all five indicators have been calculated for Bornholm Basin, Western Gotland Basin, Eastern Gotland Basin, Northern Baltic Proper and Gulf of Finland. For the other basins only four indicators (without oxygen debt) have been used to calculate the eutrophication status.

-	Mean Summer Secchi depth (June-September) data from ICES database.
-	Winter (DIN), (DIP), and summer chorophyll a data have been downloaded from the Baltic Nest Institute database (DAS and NEST); additional chlorophyll a data come from ICES and SMHI.
-	Oxygen debt calculations are based on oxygen data from ICES (CTD and bottle data), and follow the approach introduced in HELCOM Indicator Sheets (2018) where the oxygen debt below halocline is assessed and general additive models are applied to address temporal, seasonal and spatial variation within the basins (more information available at the HELCOM 2013 (BSEP133)).

<br/>

#### 1.3.1 Secchi depth Indicator {-}

_Secchi depth_ reference points are set based on the results obtained in the TARGREV project (HELCOM 2013a), taking advantage of the work carried out during the EUTRO PRO project (HELCOM 2009) and national work for WFD. The final targets were set through an expert evaluation process done by the intersessional activity on development of core eutrophication indicators (HELCOM CORE EUTRO) and the targets were adopted by the HELCOM Heads of Delegations.

#### 1.3.2 Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen and Phosphorus, and Chlorophyll a {-}

Basin specific reference points for the _winter (DIN), (DIP), and summer chlorophyll_ a have been assessed from the [Baltic Sea Environmental Proceedings No 143](https://www.helcom.fi/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BSEP143.pdf9).

<br/>

#### 1.3.3 Oxygen Debt Indicator {-}

The _oxygen debt_, i.e., "missing" oxygen in relation to fully oxygenated water column, calculations follow the approach introduced in HELCOM Indicator Sheets (2018) and the same threshold values (the 95th percentiles before 1940, detected using change point analysis) are used. There are only two distinct reference points, set for the Baltic Proper (including Gdansk Basin, Eastern and Western Gotland Basins, Northern Baltic Proper, and Gulf of Finland) and for Bornholm Basin. These targets were taken also from the [Baltic Sea Environmental Proceedings No 143](https://www.helcom.fi/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BSEP143.pdf9).
