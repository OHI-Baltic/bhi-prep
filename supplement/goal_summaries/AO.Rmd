### 1.2 Goal Description

The Artisanal Fishing Opportunities goal, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, in particular in developing nations. 
This goal measures whether people who need to fish on a small, local scale have the opportunity to do so. 
It has three sub-components: stock, access, and need. 
A score of 100 means the country or region is meeting the needs of artisanal fishermen or communities by implementing institutional supports, providing access to near-shore water, and maintaining the health of targeted species.

**For the BHI, the focus is on the *stock* sub-component and will use this as a proxy for the entire goal.**

### 1.3 Model & Data

The Artisanal Fishing Opportunities goal (AO) model assesses the health of fish stocks.
Two HELCOM core indicators are included:

(1) abundance of coastal fish key functional groups (Catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) of cyprinids/mesopredators and CPUE of piscivores);
(2) abundance of key coastal fish species (CPUE of perch, cod or flounder, depending on the area). 

Environmental status assessments were provided by Jens Olsson (SLU, Sweden), see also HELCOM FISH-PRO II (http://www.helcom.fi/helcom-at-work/projects/fish-pro/).  CPUE data used in the GES assessment. Data provided by Jens Olsson was also used in trend. Slopes from each analysis available here, but CPUE data held internally in the BHI database and not accessible here.

### 1.4 Reference values

Previously, indicator status was scored per monitoring area using the assessment protocol for coastal fish (baseline or trend-based approach) => yielding whether or not the status per monitoring area is **Good Environmental Status (GES)** or **subGES**. If a monitoring station received a "sub-GES" assessment, it was given a qualifier as "low" or "high".  
Environmental status assessments were provided by Jens Olsson (SLU, Sweden). See [HELCOM FISH-PRO II](http://www.helcom.fi/helcom-at-work/projects/fish-pro/) now in progress for the [HELCOM FISH-PRO III](https://helcom.fi/helcom-at-work/projects/fish-pro-iii/) 

Now, for the newer assessment, to match the [BEAT-tool as developed within HOLAS II](http://stateofthebalticsea.helcom.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/HELCOM_The_integrated_assessment_of_biodiversity_supplementary_report_first_version_2017.pdf), indicator status was normalized in categorial classes:
- Nearest lower value of 0.125 = 0.125
- Nearest lower value of 0.375 = 0.375
- Nearest lower value of 0.6 = 0.6
- Nearest lower value of 0.875 = 0.875
where **threshold value = 0.6**. 
Threshold values for the status assessments are identified based on site-specific time-series data for each indicator, as coastal fish generally have local population structures, limited migration, and show local responses to environmental change. _See also powerpoint provided by Jens Olsson of BHI shared folder_
