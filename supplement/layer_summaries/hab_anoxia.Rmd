From [Carstensen et al. 2014](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/15/5628.abstract). Carstensen provided dbf files containing O2 (mg_L_1) for a series of years for the Baltic Proper and the Gulf of Finland. Other areas are not included in this study but at the present time have no anoxia problems - therefore they will recieve a pressure value of 0.  Data scaled between 0 and 1.\
*Will add more text here as the layers are prepared for the BHI2.0*
