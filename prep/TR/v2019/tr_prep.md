1. Background
-------------

### 1.1 Goal Description

Tourism in coastal areas is a major component of thriving coastal communities and a measure of how much people value ocean systems, i.e. by traveling to coastal and ocean areas. This goal is not about the revenue or livelihoods that are generated by tourism and recreation (that is captured in the livelihoods and economiess goal) but instead captures the value that people have for experiencing and enjoying coastal areas. A score of 100 means a region utilizes its full recreational potential without harming the ecosystem.

In the BHI, we used revenue data (gross value added of coastal tourism activities) from the EU Study on Blue Growth, as well as Eurostat data (nights spent at tourist accommodation establishments by coastal and non-coastal area) to assess the status of Tourism. Economic activities under the Coastal tourism sector, Accommodation and Transport, were included. No sustainability measure of coastal tourism on the Baltic Sea scale was found, and thus this dimension was not included in the BHI2.0.

### 1.2 Model & Data

Data for each country were downloaded from the [EU-Study on Blue Growth](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/maritimeforum/node/3550), Maritime Policy and the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region” identified the potential for Blue Growth in each of the EU Member States (MS) of the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) and at sea basin level. The tourism model also incorporates the nights of stay in accommodations in coastal regions, which used Eurostat dataset on [nights spent at tourist accommodation establishments by coastal and non-coastal area](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=tour_occ_nin2c&lang=en).

The status is the ratio of coastal tourism revenue relative to the coastal accommodations per area, scaled by the reference point.

### 1.3 Reference points

We use as the reference point, in order to scale the ratio values between zero and one, the highest ratio across all countries in a ten year timeframe. The lowest score is fixed as the lower end point.

### 1.4 Other information

External advisors/goalkeepers: Wilfried Rickels.

2. Data
-------

This prep document is used to generate and explore the following data layers:

-   `tr_accommodations_bhi2019.csv`
-   `tr_coastal_tourism_gva_bhi2019.csv`

These are saved to the `layers` folder. These are derived from or informed by the raw datasets from Eurostat and coastal tourism revenue data from the EU Blue Growth 2020 Report.

<br>

``` r
source(here::here("R", "setup.R"))
source(here::here("R", "spatial.R"))

## root location of the raw data
dir_B <- file.path(dirname(dir_prep), "bhi-data", "BHI 2.0")
dir_rawdata <- file.path(dir_B, "Goals", "TR")

```

### 2.1 Datasets with Sources

Data for all countries were downloaded from the [Eurostat Database](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database); data downloaded for 'Nights spent at tourist accommodation establishments by all NUTS regions' and 'Nights spent at tourist accommodation establishments by coastal and non-coastal area'

#### 2.1.2 EU Baltic countries GVA Data

Data for the 8 EU Baltic countries were extracted from the [2020 EU Blue economy report](https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2020_06_blueeconomy-2020-ld_final.pdf) on July 14 2020 by Andrea De Cervo. These are the same data used for the Coastal Economies subgoal, but for the Tourism goal, only a subset of the data were used. From the 'Coastal Tourism' sub-sectors are used: Accommodations, Transport, Other expenditure; and the 'Marine Transport' subsectors: Passenger Transport.

In particular, detailed info on GVA% by sub-sector and activity per member state were extracted from the tables on the [Annex I](https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2020_06_blueeconomy-2020-annexes-ld-part1_final.pdf) and [Annex II](https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2020_06_blueeconomy-2020-annexes-ld-part2_final.pdf).

### 2.2 Centralization & Normalization

#### 2.2.1 Spatial Data

**Population dataset by NUTS2 Regions, from LIV Subgoal**

``` r
## regional employment per NUTS2 assessemnt areas, raw data from eurostat
regional_pop_data <- file.path(
    dirname(dir_rawdata), 
    "LE", "LIV", "Population_Jan1", 
    "demo_r_gind3", 
    "demo_r_gind3_1_Data.csv"
  )
regional_pop <- read.csv(
  regional_pop_data, 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
rgn_pop_clean <- regional_pop %>%
  dplyr::select(year = TIME, nuts2 = GEO, nuts2_population = Value) %>%
  mutate(nuts2_population = as.numeric(stringr::str_remove_all(nuts2_population, ","))) %>% 
  filter(substr(nuts2, 1, 2) %in% c("SE", "FI", "EE", "LV", "LT", "PL", "DE", "DK")) %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = "year", names_prefix = "pop_", values_from = "nuts2_population")
```

<br>

**NUTS Regions used for Eurostat Datasets**

[Eurostat NUTS regions shapefiles can be found here](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/nuts). The NUTS 2016, 2013, 2010, 2006, and 2003 were downloaded at 1:10 million resolution (NUTS\_RG\_10M\_year\_4326\_LEVL\_2or3 files within the zipped downloads are the polygons in espg 4326 projection). These were used for the LE (livelihoods and economies) goal and are saved in the Shapefiles folder. For this goal we will use the 2016 version of NUTS2 and NUTS3 regions.

The NUTS polygons are the standardized units for Eurostat data. Tourism accommodations are reported at level 2, but 'coastal vs non-coastal' designation is done at the NUTS3 level.

Steps in the spatial wrangling code below:

-   load spatial NUTS shapefiles with sf package
-   calculate areas of the polygons and join as a new column to the sf dataframe
-   spatially intersect NUTS2 and NUTS3 to match level 3 with level 2 codes
-   calculate 'coastal area in nuts2 region' column based on coastal types of their nested nuts3 regions

``` r

#### 2.2.2 Clean Accommodation Data by NUTS2 and by Coastal areas: standardize units, rename fields/variables

Two datasets were obtained from Eurostat: (1) Accommodations data reported by NUTS2 available from 1990 to the present, and (2) Accommodations data reported by NUTS2 and separated into coastal vs noncoastal categories, available only from 2012.

**Read in the Datasets**

``` r
## regional tourism accommodation (nights) per NUTS2 assessemnt areas
tourism_accommodations_data <- file.path(
    dir_rawdata, "Accommodation", 
    "tour_occ_nin2_nuts_codes", 
    "tour_occ_nin2_1_Data.csv"
  )
tourism_accommod <- read.csv(
  tourism_accommodations_data, 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

## accommodation (nights) per NUTS2 and Coastal/Non-Coastal areas
tourism_accommodations_coastal_data <- file.path(
    dir_rawdata, "Accommodation", 
    "tour_occ_nin2c_nuts_codes", 
    "tour_occ_nin2c_1_Data.csv"
  )
tourism_accommod_coastal <- read.csv(
  tourism_accommodations_coastal_data, 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

**Clean Accommodations Data**

-   rename variables for clarity, and unselect unnecessary vars
-   check data flags
-   subset to keep only countries around the Baltic Sea
-   merge dataset on all tourism accommodations 1999-2019 with dataset on coastal accommodations recorded since 2012

In the map generated below, large 'coastal' NUTS3 regions in northern Sweden and Finland seem to maybe overly dilute the density of coastal accommodations per coastal area, since these regions actually extend quite far inland...

#### 2.2.3 Clean Coastal Tourism GVA Data: standardize units, rename fields/variables

The downloaded raw datasets provides an overview of the Blue Economy in the individual Member States. They include the established sectors, ensuring a comparable analysis across all the MS. In particular, these datasets shows an overview of the Blue Economy by sub-sector and activity for employment, GVA and turnover.

3. Prep: Wrangling & Derivations, Checks/Evaluation, Gapfilling
---------------------------------------------------------------

#### 3.1 Save Coastal Tourism Data Layer

Already wrangled and combined tourism datasets in `tr_data.rmd` so just need to visualize to plan for status calculation and reference points...

``` r
## already wrangled and combined tourism datasets in tr_data.rmd
## read data saved in data intermediate folder
coastal_tourism_value <- read_csv(file.path(dir_prep, "data", "TR", version_year, "intermediate", "tourism_data_combined.csv"))


## join with BHI regions
bhi_tourism_value <- coastal_tourism_value %>% 
  rename(eez = country) %>% 
  left_join(readr::read_csv(file.path(dir_prep, "supplement", "lookup_tabs", "rgns_complete.csv")), by = "eez") %>% 
  select(region_id, year, cntry_tourism_gva = coastal_tour_country_gva_estimate)

bhi_tourism_accomodations <- coastal_tourism_value %>% 
  rename(eez = country) %>% 
  left_join(readr::read_csv(file.path(dir_prep, "supplement", "lookup_tabs", "rgns_complete.csv")), by = "eez") %>% 
  select(region_id, year, accom_per_area = avg_accomm_per_area)


## save TR data layers
write_csv(bhi_tourism_value, file.path(dir_layers, "tr_coastal_tourism_gva_bhi2019.csv"))
write_csv(bhi_tourism_accomodations, file.path(dir_layers, "tr_accommodations_bhi2019.csv"))
```

<br/>

4. Visualizing Data Layers
--------------------------

#### 4.1 Timeseries Plots: check regional tourism accommodations time series

``` r
gridExtra::grid.arrange(
  ggplot(coastal_tourism_value) +
    geom_col(aes(x = year, y = avg_accomm_per_area), size = 0.8) +
    facet_wrap(~country, ncol = 2) +
    labs(x = NULL, y = "Accommodations per sq. km \n"),
  ggplot(coastal_tourism_value) +
    geom_col(aes(x = year, y = coastal_tour_country_gva_estimate), size = 0.8) +
    facet_wrap(~country, ncol = 2) +
    labs(x = NULL, y = "Coastal Tourism Revenue (GVA, M€) \n"),
  ggplot(coastal_tourism_value) +
    geom_col(aes(x = year, y = tourism_gva_per_accom), size = 0.8) +
    facet_wrap(~country, ncol = 2) +
    labs(x = NULL, y = "Coastal Tourism Revenue relative to \nAccommodations Density (M€/Nights/Sq.km) \n"),
  nrow = 1
)
```

5. Considerations for `BHI3.0`
------------------------------

An interesting [report form 2008 about how tourism and recreation industries in the Baltic Sea area are affected by the state of the marine environment](https://www.naturvardsverket.se/Documents/publikationer/978-91-620-5878-4.pdf). May contain interesting information relevant to out Tourism & recreation goal, particularly if we want to incorporate in the future some kind of sustainability measure.

The [Baltic Sea Tourism Center](https://bstc.eu/) may also be a good source of information, to start upgrading the BHI TR goal.

Also the World Economic Forum, [Travel and Tourism competitiveness reports](https://www.weforum.org/reports?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=travel+and+tourism+competitiveness) contain many key preformance indicators, including and environmental sustainability indicator (though these are not specific to coastal tourism).
