### 3.1 Reorganizing/wrangling

This section prepares data layers for FIS and NP at the same time, separating the fish stocks for each:

- FIS stocks: cod_22-24, cod_25-32, her_28.1, her_20-24, her_25-29,32, her_30-31
- NP stocks: spr_22-32


#### 3.1.1 Wrangle and save layers for FIS and NP Goals

The F/FMSY, B/BMSY, and landings data are the ICES stock assessment area values, expanded to have all years rows per BHI region within the stock assessment area, and row-bound to include all stocks in one table.

```{r fis_ffmsy_bbmsy and fis_landings plots, out.width = "850px"}

### 3.2 Evaluate data & sampling patterns

#### 3.2.1 Comparing with previous BHI Assessment

The code below loads FIS layers from current and prior BHI assessments so the raw metrics can be compared before scores are calculated-- an early check which can help catch data quality issues, and helpful to suss out how changes in original data might be reflected in final goal scores.

This involves matching current and prior ICES stock assessment areas, joining the datasets, and plotting values of one BHI version against the other, per metric and stock. These plots can be used to e.g. identify outliers. Values for which the ICES areas changed are highlighted so as to effects of this can be visually inspected.


```{r compare to data used in last assessment}

#### 3.2.2 Proportions of total catch over time

Of all the fisheries landings that occurred in a given area and year, what proportion is made up by each stock?  
How have these proportions changed over time?

**Note:** different stocks are assessed in different groupings of ICES areas/subdivisions and do not neatly overlap. Without more information (regardless of how catches may in reality be spatially distributed across the assessment areas and BHI regions), the partitioning of catches by BHI regions assumed uniform catch rate over the area, and thus regional:total catch fraction was assumed to be the same as rgn area:total stock area fraction. 

```{r catch proportions plots}
## proportions of stocks by BHI region and year
yearly_rgn_props <- combined_w_rgns %>% 
  dplyr::select(region_id, stock, year, landings, rgn_landings, landings_rate, area_rgn_km2) %>%
  filter(!str_detect(stock, "spr")) %>%
  group_by(region_id, year) %>% 
  mutate(rgn_yr_totCatch = sum(rgn_landings)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  ## proportion a given stock makes up of total catch in region, by year
  mutate(rgn_yr_propCatch = rgn_landings/rgn_yr_totCatch)

#### 3.2.3 Regions map for stock proportions of total catch

These proportions are the weights used for combining statuses of multiple stock into one status value for the region.

### 3.3 Status and trend

Calculating status consists of the following steps:
- derive Eastern Baltic cod penalty factor
- calculate F-scores and B-scores
- take mean of F and B scores, with data grouped by region_id, stock, year
- derive weights from landings data (proportions of catch made up of different stocks in each region)
- apply penalty for cod condition in the Eastern Baltic
- calculate status as a geometric mean weighted by proportion of catch in each region

The formulas for calculating F and B scores are based on [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098995).

<br>


#### 3.3.1 Eastern Baltic cod condition penalty factor

Biomass and mortality are not sufficient to characterize the status of the Eastern Baltic cod, as it is condition not just populations which have significantly declined. Fulton's K is used as a measure of condition. The following method based on [Casini et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.160416) :

- Individual body condition (Fulton's K) estimated as K = W/(L^3) × 100 
- W = the total weight (g) of the fish
- L = total length (cm) of the fish
- condition averaged per length-class for each region, year
- lengths < 10 cm and ≥60 cm excluded-- not enough data
- focused on quarter 4 as it corresponds to the main feeding season


The original metric considered for this penalty factor was proportion of surveyed cod in length category 40-60cm (the most commercially important) with Fulton's K less than 0.8. However, due to small sample sizes per survey area in this length class (n = 1 some cases, increasingly common in more recent years), this metric will not suffice. Including smaller size classes 20-30cm and 30-40cm will help increase sample size, especially for future asssessments as fewer larger fish may be caught in the future.

Within ICES survey areas, country was found to have significant effect on condition. So, rather than grouping by ICES area and matching resulting penalty factors to BHI regions in the same way as with mortality and biomass data, country information was retained and used in matching to BHI regions.

#### 3.3.2 F-Scores, B-Scores, Weights

Status and trend are calculated by `functions.R` when the full BHI index is calculated. The calculations are included here also, so that parameters and results (sensitivity) can be explored. Scores are calculated in two ways (B-scores and F-scores) for each stock in a region, which are then averaged, weighted by a penalty factor if they correspond to Eastern Baltic cod, and combined for all stocks in a region as the geometric mean using catch proportions of total.

```{r calculate score component B}

metric_scores <- left_join(fis_bbmsy, fis_ffmsy,  by = c("region_id", "stock", "year"))

## B-SCORES
## calculate B-scores

## note: these parameters can be changed!
## view Bscores plot to evaluate/test different parameter values...
lowerB <- 0.9
upperB1 <- 2.5
upperB2 <- 5

B_scores <- metric_scores %>%
  mutate(
    score_type = "B_score",
    
    score = ifelse(
      bbmsy < lowerB, (1/lowerB)*bbmsy,
      ifelse(
        lowerB <= bbmsy & bbmsy < upperB1, 1, 
        ifelse(
          bbmsy >= upperB1, 
          (bbmsy - upperB2)/(upperB1-upperB2), NA
        )
      )
    )
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    score = ifelse(
      score <= 0.1, 0.1, 
      ifelse(score > 1, 1, score)
    )
  )

ggplot(data = B_scores, aes(bbmsy, score, color = score)) + geom_line() + 
  labs(title = "B-scores vs. B/BMSY values") + ylab(NULL) + xlab(NULL) +

```

Calculating F-scores is slightly more complicated, using both B/BMSY and F/FMSY ratios:

```{r calculate score component F}
## F-SCORES
## calculate F-scores
## kind of an ugly function,
## derived so that parameters are bounds on F and B which can be conceptualized, and adjusted

## note: these parameters can be adjusted, as can the B-score parameters above 
## view Bscores and Fscores plots to evaluate/test different parameter values...
## low lowerF ~ tolerance for low catch: doesn't differentiate whether to allow recovery, or despite high effort...
lowerF <- 0.8
upperF1 <- 1.1
upperF2 <- 5

## make this a function so it's easier to explore parameters...
calcFscores <- function(input_data, lowB = 0.8, lowF = 0.8, uppF1 = 1.2, uppF2 = 2.5){

            )
          )
        ),

      )

}

Use F and B scores to calculate overall `FIS` goal status:

1. Use the average catch for each stock/region across the last 15 years to obtain weights
2. Apply Eastern Baltic cod condition penalty factor
3. Take geometric mean weighted by proportion each stock comprises of total catch in each region

```{r calculate scores penalized by poor condition and scores aggregated by BHI region}

## WEIGHTS
## calculate weights with landing data
## we use the average catch for each stock/region across the last 25 years to obtain weights
weights <- yearly_rgn_props %>%
  filter(year > max(year) - 26) %>%
  dplyr::select(region_id, stock, year, landings = rgn_landings) %>% # BHI1.0 used ICES area rather than rgn values
  ## each region/stock will have same avg catch across years, timeseries mean
  group_by(region_id, stock) %>% 
  mutate(avgCatch = mean(landings)) %>% 
  group_by(region_id, year) %>%
  mutate(totCatch = sum(avgCatch)) %>% # total (i.e. all stock) catch on average (across years)
  ungroup() %>%
  ## average prop. of catch each stock accounts for, over last 25yr
  mutate(propCatch = avgCatch/totCatch)

# chk <- weights %>%
#   group_by(region_id, year) %>%
#   summarise(sumProps = sum(propCatch))
# unique(chk$sumProps) # sum of proportions of landings for each region/year sums to one

## visualize for example region three
ggplot(filter(weights, region_id == 3)) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = avgCatch)) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = landings), color = "cadetblue3") +
  facet_grid(vars(stock))  +
  labs(
    x = "Year", y = "Catch (with 25 year average) by Stock\n", 
    title = "Example catch by Stock w/ time series average"
  )
```

#### 3.3.3 Status

```{r calculate status}

## geometric mean weighted by proportion (hence the weights df) of catch in each region
status_with_penalty <- weights %>% 
  
  ## start with overall score as an average of B-scores and F-scores
  ## these averages will be weighted by stock landings and have cod condition penalty applied
  left_join(
    rbind(B_scores, F_scores) %>%
      group_by(region_id, stock, year) %>%
      summarize(score = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% # hist(scores$score)
      left_join(
        spread(rbind(B_scores, F_scores), key = "score_type", value = "score"),
        by = c("year", "stock", "region_id")
      ),
    by =  c("region_id", "year", "stock")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(score)) %>% # remove missing data
  
  ## apply penalty because bad cod condition in eastern baltic
  left_join(cod_penalty_gf, by = c("year", "region_id", "stock")) %>% 
  mutate(penalty = ifelse(
    is.na(prop_above_pt8), 1, ifelse(

    )
  )) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-prop_above_pt8, -num_samp) %>% 
  mutate(score = penalty*score)

## calculate BHI scores, geometric means of different stocks by region
scores <- status_with_penalty %>% 
  group_by(region_id, year) %>% 
  summarize(status_prop = prod(score^propCatch)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

<br> 

```{r evaluate goal model and data}
## visualize scores/status results

### 3.4 Gapfilling

The F/FMSY and B/BMSY data processing for FIS and NP goals do not include any gapfilling or interpolation. However, the matching ICES subdivisions to BHI regions is not exact, and...

The calculation of the Eastern Baltic Cod penalty factor does involve some gapfilling. Specifically, no data was reported in for cod in the [Baltic International Trawl survey (BITS)](https://datras.ices.dk/Data_products/Download/Download_Data_public.aspx) for ICES areas 30, 31, 32 or in ICES area 29 except for Estonia. While...

## 4. Visualizing Data Layers

### 4.1 Goal Status Map

Below is a map of the `FIS` goal status scores. These are not the finalized BHI scores with pressure, resilience, or trend included- just status.
Spatially, data inputs are the same value per year per stock, across the BHI regions in which the stock exists.  
BHI status and trend scores differ spatially across regions as they are combinations of multiple stocks status weighted by landings proportions.

```{r goal status map, results = "show"}
## combine with spatial info for mapping
scores_shp <- bhi_rgns_shp %>% 
  dplyr::select(rgn_nam, rgn_key, Subbasin, HELCOM_ID, BHI_ID, Area_km2) %>%
